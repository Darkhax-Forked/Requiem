# Ideas (goals to reach) for 1.0

- Make the player a unique creature (The Bureau Ethereal like)
- Include a progression system to possess new types of creatures, tier list being undead (tier 0, default), animals + spiders + creepers (tier 1, cannot break or place blocks), villagers + illagers (tier 3)
- Aura system for when the player is out of body (passive potion effects in a radius for alive players)
