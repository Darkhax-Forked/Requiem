### This mod never dies:

- New and re-written undead gameplay, fluid, cross-mod compatible, and polished (just a few bugs here and there).
- All previous items, blocks and config options not mentionned in this map are to be removed. Also, states of souls are no longer a thing, to provide the player with more "real time choices" and less "anticipated limitations".
- However, many features still stay:
  - Remnant / vanilla soul selection (strong / weak). When joining a world for the first time, the player will be granted the choice between the mod's death system or the vanilla death system.
  - Soul player state. If the player is a Remnant, upon death, his soul leaves his body, allowing a free roaming of the world in order to select a new body to inhabit.
  - Undead possession. Since it has been re-written to be the most enjoyable possible, the undead possession system is here to stay. When in soul mode, you will be able to enter any undead monster's body and control them. This will give you access to their inventories, advantages but also inconveniences.

### Items:

- Human flesh (raw): 
  - When eaten by a human player, restores 4 food points, but has a 60% chance of inflicting nausea for 15 seconds.
  - When killing a human player or villager, drops 1-3.
  - When eaten by an undead player regenerates 4 health points.
  - When eaten by an undead player, has a chance of $hp * 4$ % to revert it back to human.
  - Can be crafted (unshaped) with rotten flesh and ghast tears (1:1:1).
- Human organs:
  - Serve the same purpose as the human flesh.
  - Drops independant from each other (you can drop both a heart and a brain at the same time).
  - Used for potion brewing.
  - Organs:
    - Heart, 5% drop chance.
    - Brain, 10% drop chance.
- Obnoxious Potion:
  - Obtained when brewing human flesh in a water bottle.
  - Ineffective, like its thick, mundane and  awkward counterparts, but serves as a intermediary to brew other potions.
- Eau de mort:
  - Obtained by brewing a human brain in an obnoxious potion.
  - When drank:
    - If the player is a Remnant, expediates the consumer's soul outside their body, leaving behind an empty body (inert human body or undead mob).
    - If the player is not a Remnant, applies nausea for 1 minute and switches the player's soul status to Remnant. Writes in chat for the player: "Despite the headache, you feel abnormally lightened."
- Sanguine potion:
  - Obtained by brewing a human heart in an obnoxious potion.
  - When drank:
    - If the player is a Remnant and human, removes its Remnant status. Writes in chat for the player: "You feel blood pumping in your veins."
    - Else, can be drank but has no effect.

### Config options:

- `forceRemnant`: When true, all players will be forced into being Remnants, totally disabling the vanilla death system, and also disabling the cooked human flesh effect.
- `skipDeathScreen`: When true, upon death, the death screen will be skipped, resulting in a more fluid experience. This only applies to remnant players. This can cause some interferences with other mods that use the death screen related events.

### Commands (when cheats enabled):

- `/dissolution setRemnant [player|@] [true|false]`: If true, sets the selected player(s) as Remnant(s). If false, sets them as vanilla players.
