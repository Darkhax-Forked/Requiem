### First DLC

Warlocks is the first DLC the mod is going to receive. What this means is that the content mentionned in this roadmap will be an accessible expansion with its own Curse Forge project page. Upon launching Dissolution for the first time, you will be asked which expansions you'd wish to play, and the mod will automatically download these expansions for you to play after a Minecraft restart.

Warlocks is going to be released in multiple parts (I, II and III), each adding one special warlock to the expansion. Warlocks Part I (1.0) centers itself around the construction of the base mechanics the expansion will need, along with its first warlock : the Necromancer.

### New items

- Scroll of unsealing:
  - Can be bought from a Cleric Villager for 28-32 emeralds.
  - When using it, you hold it for 8 seconds before it's destroyed.
  - If near a locked Warlock phylactery, unlocks it.
- Possessive soul fragment:
  - Obtained after killing the Necromancer.
  - If the player doesn't have the ability to possess Necromancers, the item can be consumed in order to claim that ability.
    - Upon successful use: "You feel your soul burning with a desire strong enough to overtake any Necromancer."
  - When using it, you hold it for 4 seconds before it's destroyed.
- Occulares :
  - Ancient powerful artifacts given to Warlocks.
  - Can only be used by Warlocks (when in a Warlock's inventory and usable, eye is open, else it's closed).
  - Each Warlock type has its own Occulare type.
  - Each occulare consumes a certain type of charges.
  - Occulare charges:
    - When holding an Occulare in hand and if the Warlock has less than 20 charges, they receive one corresponding charge every 2 seconds.
    - Charges can not be transferred to chests or other containers.
    - When dropped by a Warlock (dropped intentionnally or after death), they get destroyed.
  - When using an Occulare, the amount of charges the Warlock currently has defines the attack.
  - Occulare added in this part:
    - Eye of the dead:
      - Required charge item: Voodoo flame
      - When used:
        - [10] Summons 3 puppets
        - [20] Makes undead in a 6 blocks radius fight for the Warlock
        - [60] For every puppet or undead under the Warlock's control in a 8 blocks radius, the Warlock regenerates 2 health points

### New blocks

- Phylactery (necromancer):
  - Spawns in the center of the Warlock prisons.
  - Cannot be harvested from any tool.
  - Has the same resisting properties as the obsidian (when containing a soul).
  - In order to be unlocked, a scroll of unsealing needs to be read in the prison.
  - When unlocked and interracted with the required key, opens up.
    - If an undead is in the Warlock prison, this undead transforms into the corresponding Warlock.
    - If no undead is in the prison, the phylactery closes after 30 seconds.
    - If the Warlock is defeated, the soul of the Warlock goes back into the phylactery, allowing anyone to summon it another time.
    - If the Warlock defeats the player(s), the phylactery converts into an empty phylactery, that can be harvested with bare hands.
  - Empty phylactery:
    - Tooltip: "The consolation prize for letting escape a thousands of years old evil sorcerer, that is probably raining down fire and raising hell on poor villagers somewhere in this world."

### New entities

- Warlocks:
  - Ancient powerful sorcerers, whose souls are now trapped in phylacteries.
  - Undead mob, but can't be possessed by normal players.
    - In order to possess a Warlock, you will have to first defeat him. When defeated, each Warlock drops a specific soul upgrade, allowing to possess the same type of Warlock next time you encounter one.
  - If a Warlock manages to win the fight, and no player sees it, it will escape, therefore despawning.
    - However, it can be randomly encountered again by the same player who freed his soul.
  - Warlock added in this part:
    - The Necromancer
- Puppet:
  - Special skeletons that fight for the Necromancer who summoned them.
  - Same stats as regular skeletons, not wielding any weapon.
  - Doesn't burn in sunlight.
  - When killing any target, the target will drop 0 to 3 Voodoo flames.
  - Lifespan of 25 seconds.
