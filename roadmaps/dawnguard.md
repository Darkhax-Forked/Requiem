# Dawnguard DLC (or some other non-copyrighted name)

**Goals:** 
- Add an alternative way of obtaining organs
- Balance possession with enemies that attack zombies
- Make the world feel more alive

## Balance changes (probably introduced in a regular update)
Humans only drop flesh when they are killed by
undeads.

## Unique content

### Entities
#### The Guard
They will hunt any undead with their enchanted weapons.
Normally friendly to any living creature, they will
retaliate against their attackers. They spawn rarely in
small groups around the player. Drops coins when killed,
as well as standard human drops.

They could possibly be hired as companions with an
adequate sum.

#### The Dawnguard Priest
A priest often seen accompanying a group of guards,
he can trade various things using a currency unique to
the guards and him.

#### The Lich NPC
An NPC appearing in standard villages, the Lich is
an undead who somehow leads a more or less
normal villager life. They are however open to some
shadier business, offering you human parts against
the unique currency of the Dawnguard.

### Enchantments
#### Sun blessing
An enhanced smite that can be cumulated with sharpness
but not regular smite. A Dawnguard priest can exchange
a regular *smite* book against a book of this enchantment.

When an undead is killed with a sun blessed weapon,
it drops a [special item](#to-be-named), that can be sold to a Dawnguard
priest against their currency. This effect has a rate
limit, after 5? undeads killed in under 30s?, it stops.

### Items
#### Dawnguard currency
A special coin that is only used by the Dawnguard. The 
lich also seems interested in them for some reason.

#### [To be named]
An item
